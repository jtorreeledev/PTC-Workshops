# TDD - Test-driven development


## Red > Green > Refactor > Repeat
1. Write a failing test
2. Write code to pass the test
3. Clean and optimize the code

## Advantages
1. Think POO with classes -> easier to understand
2. What code must do -> build business logig earlier, even before building the app
3. Execute and get feedback -> guard breaking changes
4. Modular code
5. Maintanable code - 1 test per requirement
6. Documentation - helps understand why this code has been written


---

## Disadvantage
Not easy to write for noobs, TDD is an art !

## xUnit exemple (shouldly, FluentAssertion)

### console / cli / cmd
```
dotnet --version
mkdir MyFirstUnitTests
cd MyFirstUnitTests
dotnet new xunit
donet build
dotnet test
```
### Visual Studio

### xUnit
- Facts are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.
- Theories are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.

---


## Steps 'AAA'
```
    // arrange - representation of data
    // act - simulate the call
    // assert - assert test passed or failed
```
